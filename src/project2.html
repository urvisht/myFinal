          <p>Yahoo! is an American web services provider headquartered in Sunnyvale,
            California, and owned by Verizon Media. The original Yahoo! company was
            founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated
            on March 2, 1995. Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era
            in the 1990s. Yahoo Mail offers a slightly more robust filter that will
            automatically move messages into a folder of your choice according to sender,
            recipient, subject or email body text. AOL Mail improves upon Yahoo's filter
            with the option to have an alert sent to your cellphone or AOL Instant
            Messenger account.</p>
          <p>Yahoo! was started at Stanford University. It was founded in January 1994 by Jerry Yang
            and David Filo, who were Electrical Engineering graduate students when they created a
            website named "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web".</p>
          <p>After Yahoo first launched in 1994, users flocked to the web portal for their online
            news, email and search needs. A string of poor business choices has ultimately led
            to the company's demise, and recently Verizon agreed to purchase Yahoo's core business
            for $4.83 billion.</p>
