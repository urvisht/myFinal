                        marketed by Verizon Media. The service traces its history to an online service known as PlayNET,
                        which hosted multi-player games for the Commodore 64. They had about 3 million active users by
                        1995. Aol is still around but not as efficient with keeping up with all the mail which is sent
                        to an active users mailbox.
