                    <p>Started by Jawed Karim, Steve Chen, and Chad Hurley, YouTube first launched in 2005 and
                        has now become one of the most visited websites in the history of the internet. As
                        employees of PayPal, the three soon realized, in 2004, that there wasn't one location
                        where videos could be shared.</p>
                    <p>YouTube was originally created as a platform for anyone to post any video content they
                        desired. It was hoped that users could use the site to upload, share, and view content
                        without restriction. It has since grown to become one of the foremost video
                        distribution sites in the world.</p>
                    <p>In 2006, YouTube was purchased by Google, "for $1.65 billion in a stock-for-stock
                        transaction". 3 YouTube still operates independently from Google to keep the community
                        that has been with YouTube from the start.  Steve and Chad are now the CEO and Chief
                        Technology Officer of YouTube, respectively.</p>
