                        Ever wonder what websites have the most searches and are being used the most in the country.
                        There has been news that Google is at the top of the list because of those rapid search engines
                        and useful data that is provided.

                        Google is an American multinational technology company founded in 1998 that specializes in
                        Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search
                        engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. But way before google was even a thing AOl and
                        Yahoo had a bit of a kick start but didn't stay to long due to how easy Google has made it to
                        search and not obtain any issues.

                        AOL is an American web portal and online service provider based in New York City. It is a brand
                        marketed by Verizon Media. The service traces its history to an online service known as PlayNET,
                        which hosted multi-player games for the Commodore 64. They had about 3 million active users by
                        1995. Aol is still around but not as efficient with keeping up  with all the mail which is sent
                        to an active users  mailbox. Yahoo actually hosted a better server to take care of the missing
                        and suspicious emails that were being received by the AOL users complained about.

                        Yahoo! is an American web services provider headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, and owned by
                        Verizon Media. The original Yahoo! company was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January
                        1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995. Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet
                        era in the 1990s. Yahoo Mail offers a slightly more robust filter that will automatically move
                        messages into a folder of your choice according to sender, recipient, subject or email body
                        text. AOL Mail improves upon Yahoo's filter with the option to have an alert sent to your
                        cellphone or AOL Instant Messenger account.
