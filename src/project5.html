                    <p>Facebook, American company offering online social networking services. Facebook was
                        founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes,
                        all of whom were students at Harvard University. Facebook became the largest social
                        network in the world, with more than one billion users </p>
                    <p>The original purpose of Facebook, or "The Facebook" as it was known then, was to allow
                        Harvard students to use their ". edu" email addresses and photos to connect with other
                        students at the school. Zuckerberg foresaw a way of bringing the existing social
                        experience of college onto the Internet.</p>
