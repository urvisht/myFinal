                            Google is right now the most successful in terms of having the most searches as of October
                        2019. They have been through a lot as a company and having such a huge audience gives them that.
                        Towards the end of october they have hit 77 billion searches. which is an astronomical number
                        for a company that was getting conquered by AOL and Yahoo.
