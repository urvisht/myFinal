          <p>AOL is an American web portal and online service provider based in New
            York City. It is a brand marketed by Verizon Media. The service traces
            its history to an online service known as PlayNET, which hosted multi-player
            games for the Commodore 64. They had about 3 million active users by 1995.
            Aol is still around but not as efficient with keeping up with all the mail
            which is sent to an active users mailbox. Yahoo actually hosted a better
            server to take care of the missing and suspicious emails that were being
            received by the AOL users complained about.</p>
          <p>From 1985 onward, Case nurtured Quantum from a few thousand members to more than
            100,000.” In 1991, Quantum was renamed America Online. By 1993, AOL introduced its own
            email addresses, a Windows version and access to the rest of the Internet for
            its users.</p>
          <p>AOL Today. To those who wonder, “Is AOL down?” The answer is it is not. AOL is still
            alive and technically still making most of its money from subscribers to the various
            services it offers. These days, those services include broadband.</p>
