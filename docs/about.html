                            <p>Most Popular websites</p>
                            <p>Ever wonder what websites have the most searches and are being used the
                                most in the country. There has been news that Google is at the top of the
                                list because of those rapid search engines and useful data that is provided.</p>
                            <p>Google is an American multinational technology company founded in 1998
                                that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include
                                online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software,
                                and hardware. But way before google was even a thing AOl and Yahoo had
                                a bit of a kick start but didn't stay to long due to how easy Google has
                                made it to search and not obtain any issues.</p>
                            <p>AOL is an American web portal and online service provider based in New
                                York City. It is a brand marketed by Verizon Media. The service traces
                                its history to an online service known as PlayNET, which hosted multi-player
                                games for the Commodore 64. They had about 3 million active users by 1995.
                                Aol is still around but not as efficient with keeping up with all the mail
                                which is sent to an active users mailbox. Yahoo actually hosted a better
                                server to take care of the missing and suspicious emails that were being
                                received by the AOL users complained about.</p>
                            <p>Yahoo! is an American web services provider headquartered in Sunnyvale,
                                California, and owned by Verizon Media. The original Yahoo! company was
                                founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated
                                on March 2, 1995. Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era
                                in the 1990s. Yahoo Mail offers a slightly more robust filter that will
                                automatically move messages into a folder of your choice according to sender,
                                recipient, subject or email body text. AOL Mail improves upon Yahoo's filter
                                with the option to have an alert sent to your cellphone or AOL Instant
                                Messenger account.</p>
